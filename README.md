üöÄ The API server will be ready on localhost. See documentation below. 

## Who is this for?

AuthCompanion‚Äôs development is opinionated.  That means the default configuration should be secure, sane and ready for production.  Configuration changes are kept to a minimum, ensuring that Authcompanion can start-up quickly and run smoothly in any environment - without having to study the docs for hours. 

We aim to keep complexity to the minimum.  If you are interested in a new feature please open an issue to discuss it before starting work.  We want to make sure any new features align to our AuthCompanion's tenants of simplicity and ease of use.

Think of AuthCompanion as a base template for user management; which helps you to build web application prototypes FASTER.  

## Features
AuthCompanion fulfills the most common identity and user management needs for web applications, including:

- [x] **Login and Registration:** Users can create and sign into accounts using email and password. Users are stored in a Postgres environment.
- [x] **Profile and Credentials Management:** Update password and profile information using RESTful APIs. 
- [x] **Account Recovery:** Restore user access using flows for "Forgot Password" and a Magic Link. Email is used as the user notification mechanism. 

AuthCompanion ships without HTML Rendering, so you'll need to bring your own UI framework to make use of the feature APIs.
